feature for people to bring ingredients together to make food together 
    would involve something where we could make people communicate what ingredients they have for a short specified amount of time so they can collaborate and discover new recipes

feature for people to like and rate food that they have tried, add comments, etc
    an algorithm that uses this method to suggest based on these recipes but should give a fighting chance to recipes that have not been suficiently explored
        I am thinkinng for this part, ratings are deducted from an overall really large score so that they new recipes still have a high score until bad ratings dig into this 

I like the idea of recipes having "ingredient tags" so they are easy to find
    the app could be able to match ingredients to the tags of the recipes for the best possible solutions
    should be able to suggest based on plans for meal so people can get ingredients based on something cheap they might be inerested in 

create AR that can help people even walk through the recipes and the way the ingredients go together
    possible issue: people might not want to hold their phone to while making the food
